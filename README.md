# safeco_image_processing_bot

The bot is to recieve gmail including attachments of 2 images: taget & sample image, and modify the target image to match the scheme of the sample image. 
The color modification part is done by adding the average color(RGB) difference of the 2 image to every pixel of the target image where A is not 0. 

This bot is implemented to assist my mother who is not familiar technology other than Iphone and gmail, and I don't really f/w the iphone app store enough to write her a new app.
